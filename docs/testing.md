# Running Tests in Docker

You can execute all service and frontend tests inside containers. A separate Compose file defines one-off test runners for each stack.

From the `services` directory run:

```bash
cd services
docker compose -f docker-compose.tests.yml up --build --abort-on-container-exit
```

This spins up containers that install dependencies and run the test suites:

- **analytics.tests** – runs `poetry install` and `pytest`
- **inventory.tests** – runs `poetry install` and `pytest`
- **auth.tests** – executes `dotnet test`
- **payment.tests** – runs Go unit tests
- **frontend.tests** – installs Node modules and runs Jest

Containers exit after finishing. Review their logs for results.

## Local Runs

You can also execute tests without Docker. Install dependencies with
`poetry` and run `pytest` inside each service directory:

```bash
cd services/Analytics
poetry install
pytest

cd ../Inventory
poetry install
pytest
```

When launching tests from the repository root, set `PYTHONPATH` to the
service path so imports of the `app` package resolve correctly.

## Contract Tests

Every service defines an `openapi.yaml` describing its API. Tools such as Dredd or Schemathesis can exercise the implementation against the contract to detect breaking changes. Integrate these checks into your CI pipeline alongside unit tests.
