# Service Communication and Reliability Guidelines

This document describes recommended practices for communication between services and for keeping the platform reliable as it grows.

## Service Communication Protocols

All external clients interact with the platform via HTTP/REST APIs exposed by the gateway. For performance‑sensitive internal calls, gRPC offers lower overhead and higher throughput than plain HTTP and is therefore preferred. Services can gradually expose gRPC endpoints defined with Protobuf while still presenting RESTful routes through the gateway. Each service may use its language's gRPC client or fall back to HTTP JSON when cross‑language support is simpler.

## Configuration Management and Service Discovery

Managing configuration across many services becomes complex as the system scales. A dedicated configuration service such as Spring Cloud Config, Nacos or Consul allows updating settings like database strings or API keys without redeploying. Service discovery lets instances register themselves so callers can locate them dynamically. In Kubernetes this is handled by DNS, but in docker-compose or bare‑metal environments tools such as Consul or Eureka are useful. The gateway should route requests to available instances based on these registrations.

## Health Checks and Fault Tolerance

Every service should expose a lightweight health endpoint (e.g. `/healthz`). Container orchestrators and load balancers query this endpoint to remove unhealthy instances from rotation. When deployed on Kubernetes configure liveness and readiness probes accordingly. Implement circuit breakers and retries (for example with Polly or Resilience4j) so that failures in one service do not cascade to others. Services are expected to log structured messages and expose Prometheus metrics. Unit and contract tests, debug scripts and alert rules all contribute to a resilient platform.

## Graceful Degradation and Rate Limiting

Design fallback behaviour so that critical features continue working when dependencies fail. For example, if the payment gateway is unavailable the Order service should store the order and allow the user to retry payment later or switch to another provider. Non-essential components like recommendations can simply be skipped when they fail.

Apply rate limiting at the gateway to protect backend services during traffic spikes. Limits may be enforced per IP or per user token. Excess requests can be rejected or queued so that core functionality remains responsive.

Combine these techniques with circuit breakers and retries to prevent cascading failures and keep the platform stable during partial outages or sudden load bursts.
